# Myriad

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mesos/myriad.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/mesos/myriad)

Myriad is a mesos framework designed for scaling a YARN cluster on Mesos. Myriad can expand or shrink the resources managed by a YARN cluster in response to events as per configured rules and policies.

The name _Myriad_ means, _countless or extremely great number_. In context of the project, it allows one to expand overall resources managed by Mesos, even when the cluster under mesos management runs other cluster managers like YARN.

**Please note: Myriad is a work in progress, and should not be used in production at this point.**
